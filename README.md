# Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

This project provides a way to **encrypt and decrypt images** using pixel manipulation techniques. It modifies the pixel values to make the image unreadable without the decryption process.

## How It Works

- **Encryption**: The pixel values of an image are changed using an algorithm to hide the original content.
- **Decryption**: The modified pixel values are restored to reveal the original image.

## Features

- Encrypt an image to make it unrecognizable.
- Decrypt the image to view the original content.
- Works with common image formats like PNG and JPEG.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `Pillow` for image manipulation
